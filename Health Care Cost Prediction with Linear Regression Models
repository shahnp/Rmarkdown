## Setting up the environment and data import
```{r import, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(Hmisc)
library(cowplot)
library(WVPlots)
set.seed(123)
Data <- read.csv("../input/insurance.csv")
sample_n(Data, 5)
```

## Understanding the data

* **Age**: insurance contractor age, years

* **Sex**: insurance contractor gender, [female, male]

* **BMI**: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

* **Children**: number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

* **Smoker**: smoking, [yes, no]

* **Region**: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, [northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest]

* **Charges**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance, $ *#predicted value*

```{r describe, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
describe(Data)
```

No missing values at this point in the dataset. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
```{r EDA, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
x <- ggplot(Data, aes(age, charges)) +
  geom_jitter(color = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
    theme_light()

y <- ggplot(Data, aes(bmi, charges)) +
  geom_jitter(color = "green", alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_light()

p <- plot_grid(x, y) 
title <- ggdraw() + draw_label("1. Correlation between Charges and Age / BMI", fontface='bold')
plot_grid(title, p, ncol=1, rel_heights=c(0.1, 1))


x <- ggplot(Data, aes(sex, charges)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = sex), alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_light()

y <- ggplot(Data, aes(children, charges)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = children), alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_light()

p <- plot_grid(x, y) 
title <- ggdraw() + draw_label("2. Correlation between Charges and Sex / Children covered by insurance", fontface='bold')
plot_grid(title, p, ncol=1, rel_heights=c(0.1, 1))


x <- ggplot(Data, aes(smoker, charges)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = smoker), alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_light()

y <- ggplot(Data, aes(region, charges)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = region), alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_light()

p <- plot_grid(x, y) 
title <- ggdraw() + draw_label("3. Correlation between Charges and Smoker / Region", fontface='bold')
plot_grid(title, p, ncol=1, rel_heights=c(0.1, 1))
```

* **Plot 1**: As Age and BMI go up Charges for health insurance also trends up.

* **Plot 2**: No obvious connection between Charges and Age. Charges for insurance with 4-5 chilren covered seems to go down (doesn't make sense, does it?)

* **Plot 3**: Charges for Smokers are higher for non-smokers (no surprise here). No obvious connection between Charges and Region.

## Linear Regression Model
### Preparation and splitting the data
```{r prep, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
n_train <- round(0.8 * nrow(Data))
train_indices <- sample(1:nrow(Data), n_train)
Data_train <- Data[train_indices, ]
Data_test <- Data[-train_indices, ]

formula_0 <- as.formula("charges ~ age + sex + bmi + children + smoker + region")
```

### Train and Test the Model
```{r model_0, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
model_0 <- lm(formula_0, data = Data_train)
summary(model_0)
#Saving R-squared
r_sq_0 <- summary(model_0)$r.squared

#predict data on test set
prediction_0 <- predict(model_0, newdata = Data_test)
#calculating the residuals
residuals_0 <- Data_test$charges - prediction_0
#calculating Root Mean Squared Error
rmse_0 <- sqrt(mean(residuals_0^2))
```

As we can see, summary of a model showed us that some of the variable are not significant (*sex*), while *smoking* seems to have a huge influence on *charges*. Training a model without non-significant variables and check if performance can be improved.

### Train and Test New Model
```{r model_1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
formula_1 <- as.formula("charges ~ age + bmi + children + smoker + region")

model_1 <- lm(formula_1, data = Data_train)
summary(model_1)
r_sq_1 <- summary(model_1)$r.squared

prediction_1 <- predict(model_1, newdata = Data_test)

residuals_1 <- Data_test$charges - prediction_1
rmse_1 <- sqrt(mean(residuals_1^2))
```


### Compare the models
```{r comparison, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
print(paste0("R-squared for first model:", round(r_sq_0, 4)))
print(paste0("R-squared for new model: ", round(r_sq_1, 4)))
print(paste0("RMSE for first model: ", round(rmse_0, 2)))
print(paste0("RMSE for new model: ", round(rmse_1, 2)))
```

As we can see, performance is quite similar between two models so I will keep the new model since it's a little bit simpler.

### Model Performance
```{r performance, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
Data_test$prediction <- predict(model_1, newdata = Data_test)
ggplot(Data_test, aes(x = prediction, y = charges)) + 
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.7) + 
  geom_abline(color = "red") +
  ggtitle("Prediction vs. Real values")

Data_test$residuals <- Data_test$charges - Data_test$prediction

ggplot(data = Data_test, aes(x = prediction, y = residuals)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = residuals), color = "blue", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 3, color = "red") +
  ggtitle("Residuals vs. Linear model prediction")

ggplot(Data_test, aes(x = residuals)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, fill = "blue") +
  ggtitle("Histogram of residuals")

GainCurvePlot(Data_test, "prediction", "charges", "Model")
```


We can see the errors in the model are close to zero so model predicts quite well.

### Applying on new data

Let's imagine 3 different people and see what charges on health care will be for them.

1. **Bob**: 19 years old, BMI 27.9, has no children, smokes, from northwest region.

2. **Lisa**: 40 years old, BMI 50, 2 children, doesn't smoke, from southeast region.

3. **John**: 30 years old. BMI 31.2, no children, doesn't smoke, from northeast region.

```{r new_test, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
Bob <- data.frame(age = 19,
                  bmi = 27.9,
                  children = 0,
                  smoker = "yes",
                  region = "northwest")
print(paste0("Health care charges for Bob: ", round(predict(model_1, Bob), 2)))

Lisa <- data.frame(age = 40,
                   bmi = 50,
                   children = 2,
                   smoker = "no",
                   region = "southeast")
print(paste0("Health care charges for Lisa: ", round(predict(model_1, Lisa), 2)))

John <- data.frame(age = 30,
                   bmi = 31.2,
                   children = 0,
                   smoker = "no",
                   region = "northeast")
print(paste0("Health care charges for John: ", round(predict(model_1, John), 2)))
```
